	<div class="content">
		<p>
			I am the adopted son of wonderful parents. I have two older siblings and a younger brother 
			who is my biological brother.
		</p>
		<p>
			I lived in Michigan until I turned thirteen when my family moved to Arkansas. I graduated 
			high school in Hot Springs, and I graduated with a BA in Political Science from the University of 
			Central Arkansas in Conway.
		</p>
		<p class="lastP">
			I moved to Denver in 2008. I met my wife here, and our son Hunter was born in 2016. My family and I 
			attend Park Church in the Highlands	neighborhood. We live in Wash Park with our (read: my) dog Snuggs.
