	</div>
	<div class="content">
		<p>I am the adopted son of wonderful parents. I have two older siblings and a younger brother who is my biological brother.</p>

		<p>I lived in Michigan until I turned thirteen when my family moved to Arkansas. I graduated high school in Hot Springs, and I graduated with a BA in Political Science from the University of Central Arkansas in Conway. </p>

		<p class="lastP">I moved to Denver in 2008. I met my wife here, and our son Hunter was born in 2016. My family and I attend Park Church in the Highlands	neighborhood. We live in Wash Park with our (read: my) dog Snuggs.</p>
