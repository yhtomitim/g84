		<h2>A little about me</h2>
			<p>
				I am the adopted son of a wonderful parents. I have two older siblings, and a younger brother 
				who is my real brother.
			</p>

			<p>
				I lived in Michigan until I turned thirteen when my family moved to Arkansas. I graduated 
				high school in Hot Springs, and I graduated with a BA in Political Science from the University of 
				Central Arkansas in Conway.
			</p>

			<p>
				I moved to Denver in 2008. I met my wife here, and our son Hunter was born in 2016. My family and I 
				attend Park Church in the Highlands	neighborhood. We live in Wash Park with our (read: my) dog Snuggs.
			</p>
