        <p>
            I am learning how to use git in the command line. This is an
            important skill for me to learn as it 1)keeps me using the command
            line 2) builds proficiency in the usages of git and 3) provides an 
            employable skill.
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of the learn to learn process, I am working on "clearing the stage."
            The video below shows my actual process for clearnig the stage on my Mac, but I
            put my iPhone in Do Not Disturb mode, and I listen to some classical music to
            block out distraction. When I forget to clear the stage, I find myself answering
            all my notifications, making it very hard to stay on track.
        </p>
        <p>
            To make sure I'm learning well, I really enjoy the "play" compoenent of learn to learn.
            I think what's been great about play with regards to git is that I'm not working with any
            production-type repos, so I'm able to start over again if I've gotten confused. The act of doing
            and experiencing while using git has been invaluable.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reflection component of learn to learn is important to commit what I learned to long-term memory.
            I hope to become super proficient in using and troubleshooting git so that I can help my classmates and
            have another employable skill.
        </p>
