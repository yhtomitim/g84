        <h2>Learning to Learn Git</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            I am learning how to use git in the command line. This is an
            important skill for me to learn as it 1)keeps me using the command
            line 2) builds proficiency in the usages of git and 3) provides an 
            employable skill.
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of the learn to learn process, I am working on "clearing the stage."
            The video below shows my actual process for clearnig the stage on my Mac, but I
            put my iPhone in Do Not Disturb mode, and I listen to some classical music to
            block out distraction. When I forget to clear the stage, I find myself answering
            all my notifications, making it very hard to stay on track.
        </p>
        <p>
            To make sure I'm learning well, I really enjoy the "play" compoenent of learn to learn.
            I think what's been great about play with regards to git is that I'm not working with any
            production-type repos, so I'm able to start over again if I've gotten confused. The act of doing
            and experiencing while using git has been invaluable.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reflection component of learn to learn is important to commit what I learned to long-term memory.
            I hope to become super proficient in using and troubleshooting git so that I can help my classmates and
            have another employable skill.

        <h2>Learning to Learn vim</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">  
        <p>
            I learned about the command line text editor vim. I was very wary of using it at first, mainly because 
            I am unfamiliar with it. One of our drills was to use a command line text editor, so I decided this was 
            the time to get familar. This skill will prove helpful in 1) staying in the command line environemnt for 
            some text editing needs and 2) using vim when I need to.

        <p> To make sure I'm learning well, I really enjoy the "play" compoenent of learn to learn. With vim, I found a 
            really cool web resource with some quick commands to use to do some basic navigation. One thing that freaked 
            me out about vim was that I couldn't ever figure out how to "exit" the application. Once I figured out the 
            command and insert modes, it was much clearer. It was also nice to know I was "playing" instead of trying to 
            accomplish something- other than learning.

        <h2>Learning to Learn firebase</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">  
        <p>
            I learned how to deploy websites using Firebase. I was familiar with using Wordpress and GitHub pages, but not Firebase. 
            I think this skill will help in quickly deploying an app to the web 2) allowing for quick "in the wild" testing.
        </p>

            As part of the learn to learn process, I am working on "clearing the stage."

        <p> To make sure I'm learning well, I really enjoy the "play" compoenent of learn to learn. With firebase, I really enjoyed
            seeing how my changes were uploaded almost instantly with firebase deploy. Also, I had enabled 2-factor authentication on 
            my google account, so it was neat to look up how to create a two-factor app password. I enjoyed that we can use it from the 
            terminal.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reflection component of learn to learn is important to commit what I learned to long-term memory.
            I hope that by using firebase, I can very quickly deploy sites and troubleshoot. I also think that using firebase is a good 
            employable skill.
