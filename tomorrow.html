            I am really excited about this new chapter in my career and life. First, I hope to complete the WDI with minimal 
            emotional scarring. I don't really know which type of developement I prefer, so I am looking forward to learning all I

            team of developers and engineers would is appealing. There is some appeal in perhaps starting my own business, but I've 
            learned it's best to not put the cart before the horse.
